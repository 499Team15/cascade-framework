+ Can you extract a cascade from just a networkx graph? Assuming the timestamps are in the nodes
+ What is he looking for in the interface?

    Here is what we were thinking:

    + The user implements a function in the plugin interface called produce NetworkX graph or something.
    + Then the interface comes with a function called produce cascade which takes in a networkx to produce a cascade

    Would this work?

+ Can you go over how to produce a cascade again?
+ We had an idea about querying databases, is this necessary for the project?
+ Is there a specific type of data you want the data to be from? Or should it be up to the user?
+ What are you looking for in the gui?
