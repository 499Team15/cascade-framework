- Statistical pipeline???
- Look for other possible cascade sources: facebook, other social media sites - build in functions to handle rate limit

What we actually should do:
- Implement a cascade using the interface
- Work on visualization: stuff like adding a time slider on the chart
- Make examples/tests to make sure everything works correctly
